dotfiles
========

This repository contains the dotfiles I use on OSX and Linux.
It also includes ansible playbooks for setting everything up on
my desired host properly.


```bash
$ echo "On OSX"
$ curl https://github.com/derekjamescurtis/dotfiles/blob/master/playbooks/osx.yaml --output deploy-dotfiles.yaml
```
